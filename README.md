# Color-Bars
Color Bars Test Video Generator

Uses Python to generate Color Bars following the color values of Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers to generate test videos in different resolutions and frame rate. 

These test videos are not fully color accurate but adhere to the color values outlined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), widely used in the video and broadcast industry to ensure color accuracy and consistency across devices.

## Output Formats 
### 1 . 2048 x 1080  
2K Test video generation with 24 fps and 60 fps 
### 2 . 3840 x 2160  - 4K
4k Test video generation with 60 fps
### 3 . 7680 x 4320  - 8K
8K Test video generation with 24 fps  

## Dependencies 
This project requires Python 3.x, PyAV, NumPy and PILLOW libraries.

## Customization 

Users can modify the script to generate test videos in other resolutions and frame rates. Modify the variables, width, height for resolution, fps for frame rate and duration for video length.
